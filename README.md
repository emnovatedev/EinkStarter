# Introduction 
This repo contains the software required to run the sample mobile application that connect to the E-ink development board.   It also describes the process for converting and transferring images to the E-ink screen, using a reference mobile application and development board.   Download the full implementation guide for complete instructions.

# Overview
Upon unboxing, the e-ink screen must be attached to the development board, and power must be applied using one of the supported methods.
Before images can be transferred to the screen, they must undergo a transformation.  First, their color spaces are transformed using the nColorConvert utility.  Later, the resulting images are processed using the GalleryPallette2Bin utility, to prepare them for the digital transfer process using the mobile application software.   
After conversion, the images are loaded at runtime by the mobile application, allowing for them to be transferred to the device when the appropriate commands are selected by the user.

# Hardware 
The packaging includes one development board, along with a 4-inch E-ink screen.  Upon unboxing, the screen must be attached to the development board as depicted in Figure 1 below.  After the screen is attached, power can be applied to test a proper connection.
